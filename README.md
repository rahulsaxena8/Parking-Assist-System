# Parking-Assist-System
You must have experienced problem while parking your car in a crowded parking area.There is always a fear of accidentally hitting wall or another car in the parking.
To solve this issue I have built a parking assist system for your car.
The materials used in this project are-

(1)Two ultrasonic sensors.
(2)16*2 LCD display.
(3)Arduino Uno.
(4)Piezo Buzzer.
(5)Potentiometer.
(6)Bread board and jumper wires.

Two ultrasonic sensors have been fitted on each side of back of the car. the distance between them and the obstacle is calculated and sent to the LCD display present on the dashboard of the car.So the driver can see the distance of obstackle on each side of the car. As the distance of obstacle decreases less than 15cm on any of the either side or both side an alert message is sent on the lcd and alarm also begin to ring. This alerts the driver that that he is very close to collision.
